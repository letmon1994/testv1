This is an application which fetches data from a UFC API and displays the results. The user can look at a list of fighter cards that shows the fighters profile image. Under shows the fighters name, weight division and a link to view more information about the fighter. The user can filter how the list of fighter cards appear, either by wether the fighter holds a title or not, by fighters weight division and by fighters names from a-z. The user can also search for a specfic fighter and view that fighters card. 

If a fighter card in the list is clicked where the link that says "view fighters information" then more details on the fighter will be displayed on a differnt page.

There is a puond for pound page that if the user clicks, will be direct to a table listing information about the fighter.
